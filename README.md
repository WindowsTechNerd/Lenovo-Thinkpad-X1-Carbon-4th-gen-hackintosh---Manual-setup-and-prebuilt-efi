# Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon-4th gen hackintosh - Manual setup and prebuilt efi
Welcome to the repo

# Notes

This repo is using the bootloader "Opencore" due to unstablity with clover.

Please don't follow this repo unless you want to do everything in the guide that I have managed to type before I type the rest tomorrow

At the momment, only the guide for hackintoshs and macs that are running macOS is here in this repo at the momment

You can see manual setup at the installation_macos.md file:)
